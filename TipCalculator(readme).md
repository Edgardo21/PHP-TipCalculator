## Notes

The tip calculator is one of my first experiences working with php and it was a lot of fun. The most challenging part in my opinion was learning to combine php,css,
html and the help of bootstrap to build this calculator. Another challenging part was the validation of the inputs.

This code is available to anyone that wants to use it, but use it at your own risk. :) My gift to you!!
